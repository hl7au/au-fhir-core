### Introduction
AU Core is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU Core defines the data model and RESTful API interactions that set minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search, and retrieve core digital health and administrative information. 

AU Core uses AU Base representations, where available, as the basis for profiles that define the FHIR resources to be supported, along with their elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets, and how they are used is defined. It also documents the minimum FHIR RESTful interactions for each resource type to access data. AU Core promotes interoperability and adoption through common implementation and provides the basis for further implementation guide development for specific use cases.

There are two different ways to implement AU Core:
1. Profile Only Support: systems support only the resources as profiled by AU Core to represent digital health information.
1. Profile Support + Interaction Support: systems support the resources as profiled by AU Core to represent digital health information (Profile Support) and the [RESTful FHIR API](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html) interactions defined for it (Interaction Support).

In this regard it is similar in nature to other national core specifications such as US Core FHIR Implementation Guide and international FHIR specifications such as International Patient Access FHIR Implementation Guide.

For a detailed description of the different ways to implement AU Core see the [Conformance Requirements](general-requirements.html) page.

### Project background

This implementation guide is under development through the AU Core project as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://sparked.csiro.au/). The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts, to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

The AU Core Sparked project includes:
- Australian Core Data for Interoperability - clinician focussed data requirements project.
- AU Core FHIR Implementation Guide - HL7 Australia technical data access and exchange specification.

The [Australian Core Data for Interoperability (AUCDI)](https://sparked.csiro.au/index.php/sparked-products-resources/australian-core-data-for-interoperability/aucdi-release-1/)  aims to define requirements underlying the standardisation of the capture, structure, usage, and exchange of health data to counteract the current fragmentation of Australiaâ€™s health data systems. The AUCDI forms a basis for clinical data requirements for AU Core.

### Dependencies

{% include dependency-table.xhtml %}

### Usage

AU Core is particularly useful in defining:

- A testable level of system conformance
- Assumed support by client applications
- The basis of downstream implementation guides

Implementation of capabilities defined in AU Core enables specifications, applications and business logic to be developed with confidence.

This document is a working specification that may be directly implemented by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers.

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> Connectathon events are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for 
implementation. This implementation guide will be used as the basis for Australian Connectathon events.

### AU Core Actors

The following actors are part of AU Core:

**AU Core Requestor**

A system that creates and initiates a data access request to retrieve core digital health and administrative information. The AU Core Requestor is the client in a client-server interaction.  
<br/>

**AU Core Responder**

A system that responds to the data access request submitted by requesters, providing responses to requests for core digital health and administrative information. The AU Core Responder is the server in a client-server interaction.  
<br/>

### AU Core FHIR RESTful interactions

For systems that support AU Core FHIR RESTful interactions ([Profile Support + Interaction Support](general-requirements.html#profile-support--interaction-support)), the interaction requirements, such as read and search operations, are detailed in the AU Core Requester and AU Core Responder [CapabilityStatements](capability-statements.html).

The following are simple examples of AU Core FHIR RESTful interactions between AU Core Requester and AU Core Responder actors:

**Example of a FHIR RESTful read interaction**
