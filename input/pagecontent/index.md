### Introduction
AU Core is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU Core defines the Data model and RESTful API interactions that set minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search, and retrieve core digital health and administrative information. 

AU Core uses AU Base representations as the basis for profiles that define the FHIR resources to be supported, and the elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets that SHALL be present are identified, and how they are used is defined. It also documents the minimum FHIR RESTful interactions for each resource type to access data. AU Core promotes interoperability and adoption through common implementation and SHOULD be built on top of for standards development for specific use cases. 

There are two different ways to implement AU Core:
1. Profile Only Support: systems support only the resources as profiled by AU Core to represent digital health information.
1. Profile Support + Interaction Support: systems support the resources as profiled by AU Core to represent digital health information (Profile Support) and [the RESTful FHIR API](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html) interactions defined for it (Interaction Support).

In this regard it is similar in nature to other national core specifications such as US Core FHIR Implementation Guide and international FHIR specifications such as International Patient Access FHIR Implementation Guide.

For a detailed description of the different ways to implement AU Core see the [Conformance Requirements](general-requirements.html) page.

### Project background

This implementation guide is under development through the AU Core project as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HA/Sparked+FHIR+Accelerator). The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts, to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

The AU Core project includes:
- Australian Core Data for Interoperability
- AU Core FHIR Implementation Guide

The [Australian Core Data for Interoperability (AUCDI)](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/FHIR/AUCDI+Release+1) aims to standardise the capture, structure, usage, and exchange of health data to counteract the current fragmentation of Australiaâ€™s health data systems. The AUCDI forms a basis for clinical data requirements for AU Core.

#### Contributing to AU Core Development
AU Core R1 is in currently in development. Ballot for Comment is scheduled for March 2024.

##### Join the AU Core Technical Design Group

See [How to Register - Participant Information](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/FHIR/How+to+Register+-+Participant+Information) for information on how to participate in the AU Core Technical Design Group and Clinical Design Group as part of Sparked, the Australian FHIR Accelerator.

##### Discuss an issue in chat.fhir.org

If you have a question, feature request, or proposed change, the best place to start is Zulip e.g. the Australia stream https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia.

##### Identify future work or raise discussion points

To identify future work or raise discussion points, you can post in the Australia stream https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia or raise [specification feedback](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback) through a [Jira issue tracker](https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=21325).


###### Discuss with the team

Once the issue is logged, you should discuss with the team on [chat.fhir.org in the australia > AU Core topic]( https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia/topic/AU.20Core) before attempting to make changes yourself. It's important to coordinate with the other people working on the project. When everyone has agreed on a course of action, IG changes should be submitted as a pull request for review in the [AU Core repository](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core).


### Dependencies

{% include dependency-table.xhtml %}

In addition, the following FHIR implementation guides are referenced:
- [Bulk Data Access](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata)
- [International Patient Access](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa)
- [SMART Application Launch Framework](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch)

### Usage

AU Core is particularly useful in defining:

- A testable level of system conformance
- Assumed support by client applications
- As the basis of downstream implementation guides

Assuming capabilities defined in AU Core are implemented allow specifications, applications and business logic to be developed generally with confidence that systems can readily supply this capability.

This document is a working specification that may be directly implemented by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers.

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> connectathon events are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for 
implementation. This implementation guide will be used as the basis for Australian connectathon events.

### AU Core Actors

The following actors are part of the AU Core IG:

**AU Core Requestor**

An application that initiates a data access request to retrieve patient data. The AU Core Requestor is the client in a client-server interaction. The terms "requester", "client", and "app" are used interchangeably throughout this guide and are not meant to limit this actor to patient and provider apps. Payers and other users can use the same technology. Consider these terms a short-hand notation for a "user application".
<br/><br/>

**AU Core Responder**

A system that responds to the data access request providing patient data. The AU Core Responder is the server in a client-server interaction. The terms "server", "AU Core FHIR server", "FHIR server" and "EHR" are used interchangeably throughout this guide and are not meant to limit this actor to electronic health record systems. HIEs, care coordination platforms, population health systems, etc., can use the same technology. Consider these terms a short-hand notation for an "interoperable healthcare platform".
