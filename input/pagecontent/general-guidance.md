### Contained Resources
In some circumstances, the content referred to in the resource reference does not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it - it cannot be identified independently, and nor can it have its own independent transaction scope. For example, use of a Medication resource to represent medicinal product identification within the context of a MedicationRequest. In these circumstances the resource can be [contained](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/references.html#contained). 

In AU Core profiles:
- Systems constructing a resource that represent medication information are encouraged to make use of contained resources within the context of a FHIR transaction. Operations on Medication resources are expected to be within the context of a referencing resource query such as an MedicationAdministration, MedicationDispense, MedicationRequest or MedicationStatement.
- If referencing a contained resource, both the contained resource and the referencing resource **SHALL** conform to the applicable AU Core profile.
- Otherwise, when responding to a query, it is recommended that servers avoid using inline contained resources to represent the returned data.

Further guidance about the general use case for [contained resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/references.html#contained) can be found in the base FHIR specification.

### Extensibility – “additional” elements
A server may send "additional" elements beyond those flagged with Must Support in an AU Core profile. Additional elements are often required by other profiles the system may conform to, allowing local requirements, including technical and workflow context for the resource, to be reflected and extending the health information supported in exchanges. For this reason, extensibility is generally encouraged and expected in AU Core profiles. Only in some exceptionally rare use case profiles are rules tightened to limit the nature of additional information that can be sent. Specification authors should strive to enable greater interoperability and software re-use by not reducing an element's cardinality.

Depending on local requirements, a client application may ignore these "additional" elements, may treat the data as for rendering only, or be capable of recognising and using the element. 


### Medicine information

The FHIR standard defines the following resources for exchanging medicine information:
- [Medication](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medication.html)
- [MedicationAdministration](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationadministration.html)
- [MedicationDispense](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationdispense.html)
- [MedicationRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationrequest.html)
- [MedicationStatement](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationstatement.html)

AU Core defines the profiles:
- [AU Core Medication](StructureDefinition-au-core-medication.html) is profiled to support medicinal product identification in an Australian healthcare context.
- [AU Core MedicationRequest](StructureDefinition-au-core-medicationrequest.html) (with AU Core Medication) to support prescription, ordering, and ePrescribing use cases.

It is anticipated that future releases of AU Core will define AU Core profiles of:
- MedicationAdministration (with AU Core Medication) are used to support medication chart and other administration use cases.
- MedicationDispense (with AU Core Medication) are used to support dispense records and medication management use cases.
- MedicationStatement (with AU Core Medication) are used to support summary statements of medicine use.

**Medicinal Product Identification**

For extemporaneous medications, it is expected the medication code is the primary mechanism to identify a medicine. In this case, a text only list of ingredients may be supplied or may be coded using a medicines terminology.

For non-extemporaneous medications, the medication code (or set of codes) is the mandatory primary mechanism to identify a medicine and its defining attributes (by terminology lookup) including form and strength. 

Australian Medicines Terminology (AMT) is the national terminology for identification and naming of medicines in clinical systems for Australia. 
The AMT is published monthly to include new items on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods from the TGA, as well as items listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
The AMT is published as part of SNOMED CT-AU (Australian edition of SNOMED CT) and can be downloaded in a variety of formats from the [National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS)](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/).

In addition to the medication code, the majority of use cases support exchange of structured medicine information as separate data elements covering brand name, generic name, item form and strength, and manufacturer.

These data elements may be supported as coded, or text, and systems are likely to use a combination of coded and text elements when constructing a Medication resource. The guidance for how to support coded or text is summarised below: 

1. For *coded* support for brand name, generic name, manufacturer, item form and strength:
   - Fully coded support is provided using code.coding with [Medication Type extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-medication-type.html) extension in the resource (i.e. MedicationAdministration, MedicationStatement, MedicationDispense, MedicationRequest, Medication):
      - brand name = `code.coding` with [Medication Type extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-medication-type.html) using `BPD` from the [Medication Type code system](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/CodeSystem-medication-type.html)
      - generic name = `code.coding` with [Medication Type extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-medication-type.html) using `UPD` from the [Medication Type code system](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/CodeSystem-medication-type.html)
      - generic item form and strength = `code.coding` with [Medication Type extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-medication-type.html) using `UPDSF` from the [Medication Type code system](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/CodeSystem-medication-type.html)
      - branded item form and strength = `code.coding` with [Medication Type extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-medication-type.html) using `BPDSF` from the [Medication Type code system](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/CodeSystem-medication-type.html)
   - If the resource is a Medication resource:
      - form and strength are also provided in `Medication.form`, `Medication.ingredient.itemCodeableConcept` and `Medication.ingredient.strength`
      - manufacturer = `Medication.manufacturer.identifier`

    Example: Medication with coded brand name, generic name, manufacturer, item form and strength.

### Read/Search Syntax

Searching resources is defined by the [FHIR RESTful API](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html) and included here for informative purposes. The [AU Core CapabilityStatements](capability-statements.html) document the server and client rules for the RESTful interactions described in this guide.

All the search interactions in this guide use the `GET` command with the following syntax:

 **`GET [base]/[Resource-type]?[parameter1]{:m1|m2|...}={c1|c2|...}[value1{,value2,...}]{&[parameter2]{:m1|m2|...}={c1|c2|...}[value1{,value2,...}]&...}`**

-   GET is the HTTP verb used for fetching a resource
-   Variables surrounded by "\[\]" are mandatory *for the client* to supply and will be replaced by the string literal identified.
-   Variables surrounded by "\{\}" are optional *for the client* to supply and will be replaced by the string literal identified.
-   Variables:
    -   base: The Service Root URL (e.g., "<https://fhir-open-api-dstu2.smarthealthit.org>”)
    -  Resource-type: The name of a resource type (e.g., "Patient")
    -  parameter: the search parameters as defined for the particular interaction (e.g.,"?patient=Patient/123")
    -  value: the search parameter value for a particular search
       - When searching using the `token` type SearchParameter [(how to search by token)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#token), the syntax `{system|}[code]` means that the system value is optional *for the client* to supply.:
       - When searching using the `reference` type SearchParameter [(how to search by reference)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#reference), the syntax `{Type/}[id]` means that the Type value is optional *for the client* to supply:
       - When searching using the `date` type SearchParameter [(how to search by date)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#date), the syntax `{gt|lt|ge|le}[date]` means the date comparators "gt", "lt", "ge", and "le" are optional.   Date type searches without a comparator prefix are equivalent to searches with the "eq" comparator *even if* a server does not support the comparator.
    - \{:m1ampersand#124;m2ampersand#124;...}: The list of supported search parameter modifiers
    - {c1|c2|...}: The list of supported search parameter comparators
    - {,value2,...}: Optional multiple 'OR' Values
    - {&parameter2={:m1|m2|...}={c1|c2|...}[value1{,value2,...}&...}: Optional multiple 'AND' search parameters


In the simplest case, a search is executed by performing a GET operation in the RESTful framework:

`GET [base]/[Resource-type]?name=value&...`

For this RESTful search, the parameters are a series of name=\[value\] pairs encoded in the URL. The search parameter names are defined for each resource. For example, the Observation resource has the name "code" for searching on the LOINC or SNOMED CT-AU code.  For more information, see the [FHIR RESTful Search API](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#search).
