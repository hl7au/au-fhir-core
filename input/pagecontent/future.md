### AU Core Profiles Roadmap 

#### AU Core MedicationStatement 
The development of the AU Core MedicationStatement profile is planned for the AU Core R2 scope, following the TDG's strategic decision to prioritise the AU Core MedicationRequest profile for R1. Should time allow, the TDG plans to work on the AU Core MedicationStatement within R1 as well.
