### AU Core Yearly Updates
AU Core will be published yearly. Yearly AU Core updates reflect changes to:
 - Australian Core Data for Interoperability (AUCDI)
 - requests from the AU FHIR community. 
 
 The approach is outlined in the figure below:

### Future Scope Changes

#### AU Core MedicationStatement profile development
The MedicationStatement profile is under development for inclusion in future AU Core releases. This profile will set minimum expectations for a MedicationStatement resource to record, search, and fetch summary statements of medication use associated with a patient. Following a TDG motion, the MedicationRequest profile has been prioritised for AU Core Release 1, with plans to focus on MedicationStatement in later updates.
