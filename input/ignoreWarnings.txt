Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# === INFORMATION: Information about the AU Core use of the discriminator type 'pattern,' which is fully valid and supported in FHIR R4 but deprecated in R5+. This does not affect the functionality or conformance in R4. Future updates will consider transitioning to the recommended 'type=value' approach to ensure compatibility with R5+. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# === INFORMATION: These informational messages are triggered due to the tooling setup in the IG Publisher, which infers the default language (en-AU) from the jurisdiction. The terminology server (tx.ontoserver) used for validation does not support en-AU for SNOMED CT lookups and instead expects en. This is a known limitation of the tooling and terminology server setup.
