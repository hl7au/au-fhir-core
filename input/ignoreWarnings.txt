# === PBS terminology content is not published in FHIR format, validation is not expected. This issue was accepted by the HL7 AU FHIR Working Group in AU Base v5.0.0. ===

# === Warnings ====
# =========================================================================================

# === WARNING: These are warnings for publication artefacts not used in HL7 AU specifications at this time and are accepted by the AU FHIR WG. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0. ===  
The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === WARNING: The following warnings flag aspects of FHIR implementation of best practice. These warnings do not indicate an error in the specification, and ignore profiled requirements. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0.+==
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# === WARNING: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) from AU Base. The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Core and AU Base. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0. ===

# === WARNING: Examples with PBS concepts have this warning as there is no publicly available instance of the PBS code system and therefore IG Publisher cannot validate the concept. This is known, accepted behaviour for IG Publisher. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0. ===
