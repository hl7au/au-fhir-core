Note that at present, it is not proposed that there be a specific AU Core Dosage profile, but rather that the elements within Dosage are indicated with their own constraints within the profiles that use Dosage. The Dosage datatype is used across MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement (and MedicationDispense) and imposing a Dosage profile that affects all of the medication profiles may be limiting, however we are interested in feedback on this approach also.

Feedback on this proposal can be provided here by end of 14 Mar 2025: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HAFWG/pages/325454263/AU+Core+R2+Dosage+Draft+Discussion">AU Core R2 Dosage Draft Discussion</a>.

This proposal will be voted on during the AU Core TDG Main Call 18 March. See connection details from <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HAFWG/pages/307303536/2025-03-18+AU+Core+TDG+Agenda+Minutes">2025-03-18 AU Core TDG Agenda/Minutes</a>.
