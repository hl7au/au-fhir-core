- `Observation.category` provides an efficient way of supporting system interactions, e.g. restricting searches. Implementers need to understand that data categorisation is somewhat subjective. The categorisation applied by the source may not align with a receiver’s expectations.
- Additional codes that translate or map to the Observation code or category codes are allowed. For example, providing both a local code and the required code.
