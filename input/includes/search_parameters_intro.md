Below is an overview of the mandatory and optional search parameters and combined search parameters. See the [AU Core CapabilityStatements](capability-statements.html) for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

FHIR search operations are described <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html">here</a> and the syntax used to describe AU Core interactions is defined <a href="general-guidance.html#readsearch-syntax">here</a>.

Any search parameter defined in FHIR may be 'allowed' by the system unless explicitly marked as "**SHALL NOT**". A few items are marked as **MAY** in this implementation guide to highlight their potential relevance.
