<div class="stu-note" markdown="1">

The additional obligation for `Immunization.occurenceDateTime` for [AU Core Responder](ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-responder.html) is [SHOULD:populate](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/CodeSystem-obligation.html#obligation-SHOULD.58populate). There is no additional obligation for [AU Core Requester](ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-requester.html), the obligation of [SHALL:no-error](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/CodeSystem-obligation.html#obligation-SHALL.58no-error) applies.

This obligation is present in the underlying structure but due to a tooling limitation is not currently rendered in the profile view. See [Zulip discussion](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Obligation.20on.20ElementDefinition.2Etype) for more information.
