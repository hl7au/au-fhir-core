### Comparison with other national and international specifications

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [IPA-Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/StructureDefinition-ipa-patient.html)
- [Patient (IPS)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/STU1.1/StructureDefinition-Patient-uv-ips.html)
- [US Core Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient)

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to [International Patient Access](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa), [International Patient Summary](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips), or [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core) **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.

### Gender Identity and related concepts
<b>Name to Use (NtU)​</b>

By making `name.use` a Must Support data element, this profile explicitly supports representation and exchange of the Name to Use data element (as defined in the [HL7 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: Gender Harmony - Sex and Gender Representation, Edition 1](https://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/informative1/)). Name to Use is represented using ‘usual’ in `name.use`. It should be noted that, `name.period` is not a Must Support data element in this version of the profile.

  - an international address can be represented using the core [Address](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Address) data type
  - an Australian address **SHOULD** be represented using the [Australian Address](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-au-address.html) data type profile
- When exchanging concepts of sex or gender, refer to the guidance in the [Gender Harmony Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/) and [AU Base Patient](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base//StructureDefinition-au-patient.html)
