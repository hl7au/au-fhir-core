### Usage scenarios

The following are supported usage scenarios for this profile:

- Query for a patient's allergies/adverse reactions
- Record or update a patient's allergies/adverse reactions


### Comparison with other national and international IGs

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [IPA-AllergyIntolerance](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/StructureDefinition/ipa-allergyintolerance)
- [US Core AllergyIntolerance](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-allergyintolerance)
- and **MAY** be conformant to [Allergy Intolerance (IPS)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/AllergyIntolerance-uv-ips) if patient is supported as AllergyIntolerance.patient.reference

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to [International Patient Access](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa), [International Patient Summary](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips), or [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core) **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.


### Profile specific implementation guidance
- `AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus` is "unconfirmed" where a sending system does not clearly have this element or "confirmed" depending on the level of certainty
- To represent that a patient does not have an allergy or category of allergies, an appropriate negation code (e.g. 716186003 \|No known allergy\| or 716184000 \|No known latex allergy\|) is used in `AllergyIntolerance.code`
- The use of coding can vary significantly across systems, client applications need to understand that they may encounter codes they do not recognise and be prepared to handle those resources appropriately. Servers **SHOULD** populate `AllergyIntolerance.code.text` and/or `AllergyIntolerance.code.coding.display` so that client applications can at least display the condition even if the client application does not recognise the code supplied.
- Refutation is not expected to be handled except as above - an appropriate negation code in `AllergyIntolerance.code` and `AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus` of "confirmed" or "unconfirmed"
- Where only substance is known (e.g. 111088007 \|Latex\|) and not a statement of allergy or intolerance (e.g. 300916003 \|Allergy to latex\|), the substance is sent in `AllergyIntolerance.code`
